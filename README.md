# TRack

T(yped)Rack(et) is an experimental in-progress type-checker/compiler I'm writing for
the racket language. Help is appreciated in _any_ of the following domains:

- [ ] Compiler formatting
- [ ] _Any_ enhancement to the codebas
- [ ] Environment definitions (e.g. language packs & imported libraries)
- [ ] Test suites
